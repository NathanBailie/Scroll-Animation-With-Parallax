# Scroll animation with parallax

## Description
I found the idea for this project in one of the tutorials on [WebDesign Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKjYfxei5vc) YouTube channel. The work is a website with beautiful animation of elements appearing and disappearing on scrolling with parallax effect.
